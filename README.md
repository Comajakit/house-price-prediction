# House Price Prediction

This project uses various machine learning models to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset.

## Overview

The project demonstrates the process of loading and exploring the dataset, preprocessing the data, building and training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance. The best model is saved and can be used directly without retraining.

## Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset, which is publicly available in the `sklearn.datasets` module.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Comajakit/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
